## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Navigation SDK Version**: Using 3.0.0 (older) due to ndk27 variant not available
   - Works perfectly but newer features not available
   - Will upgrade when 3.16.0-ndk27 released

2. **Marker Icons**: Currently using default markers
   - Can add custom icons for coffee shops later

3. **Simulation Mode**: Enabled by default
   - Good for testing
   - To use real GPS: change `startReplayTripSession()` to `startTripSession()`
