# Mapbox Discover SDK Implementation

## Summary
Successfully integrated Mapbox Discover SDK for finding nearby coffee shops on the map. Replaced Navigation SDK approach with the simpler and more appropriate Discover SDK.

## What Changed

### 1. Dependencies (app/build.gradle)
**Removed:**
- Mapbox Navigation SDK dependencies (were causing conflicts and not needed for this use case)

**Kept:**
- Mapbox Maps SDK 11.9.0-ndk27
- Mapbox Search SDK 2.14.0-ndk27 (includes Discover, Place Autocomplete, and Search modules)

### 2. MapScreen.kt - Complete Rewrite
**New Features:**
- ✅ **Discover SDK Integration** - Uses `Discover.create()` for coffee shop searches
- ✅ **Two Search Modes:**
  - **Search Nearby** - Finds coffee shops near user's current location
  - **Search This Area** - Finds coffee shops in the current map viewport
- ✅ **Real-time Results** - Shows up to 20 coffee shops with:
  - Name
  - Address
  - Distance from user
  - Categories
  - Location coordinates
- ✅ **Map Markers** - Automatically places markers on map for all found results
- ✅ **Camera Animation** - Automatically adjusts camera to show all results
- ✅ **Location Permissions** - Proper permission handling with UI prompts

## How It Works

### Search Flow

1. **User taps "Search Nearby Coffee Shops"**
   ```kotlin
   discover.search(
       query = DiscoverQuery.Category.COFFEE_SHOP_CAFE,
       proximity = userLocation,
       options = DiscoverOptions(limit = 20)
   )
   ```

2. **Discover SDK returns results**
   - Real coffee shop data from Mapbox POI database
   - Includes names, addresses, coordinates, categories

3. **Results displayed on map**
   - Markers placed at each coffee shop location
   - Camera adjusts to show all results
   - Results count shown to user

### Search This Area

1. **User pans/zooms map to desired area**
2. **User taps "Search This Area"**
3. **Searches within current map bounds**
   ```kotlin
   val bounds = mapView.mapboxMap.getBounds()
   discover.search(
       query = DiscoverQuery.Category.COFFEE_SHOP_CAFE,
       region = boundingBox,
       options = DiscoverOptions(limit = 20)
   )
   ```

## Key Components

### Discover SDK
```kotlin
val discover = Discover.create()
```
- Official Mapbox SDK for category-based POI discovery
- Optimized for finding places by type (restaurants, cafes, shops, etc.)
- Returns real-world data with addresses and metadata

### Location Provider
```kotlin
val locationProvider = LocationServiceFactory
    .getOrCreate()
    .getDeviceLocationProvider(null)
    .value
```
- Mapbox's location service
- Used for proximity-based searches
- Handles device location updates

### Data Model
```kotlin
data class CoffeeShopResult(
    val name: String,
    val address: String?,
    val coordinate: Point,
    val distance: Double?,
    val categories: List<String>?,
    val makiIcon: String?
)
```

## UI Features

### Map Display
- Full-screen Mapbox map with user location indicator
- Interactive gestures (pan, zoom, rotate)
- Styled with `Style.MAPBOX_STREETS`

### Search Buttons
- **Search Nearby** - Primary blue button with location icon
- **Search This Area** - Secondary purple button with search icon
- Loading states with spinner animations
- Results count display

### Permission Handling
- Location permission request card if not granted
- Clear messaging about why permission is needed
- "Grant Permission" button to trigger system dialog

## Distance Calculation
Uses Mapbox's `DistanceCalculator` for accurate geographic distance:
```kotlin
val calculator = DistanceCalculator.instance(latitude = userLatitude)
val distance = calculator.distance(origin, destination)
```
Returns distance in meters.

## Map Marker Management

### Showing Markers
```kotlin
fun showMarkersOnMap(mapView: MapView, results: List<DiscoverResult>) {
    val annotationManager = mapView.annotations.createPointAnnotationManager(null)
    
    results.forEach { result ->
        val options = PointAnnotationOptions()
            .withPoint(result.coordinate)
            .withIconAnchor(IconAnchor.BOTTOM)
        annotationManager.create(options)
    }
    
    // Adjust camera to show all markers
    mapView.mapboxMap.cameraForCoordinates(coordinates, edgeInsets)
}
```

## Example Search Results

When user clicks "Search Nearby Coffee Shops":
```
Found 15 coffee shops

Results include:
- Starbucks (0.3 km away)
  123 Main St, Seattle, WA
  
- Blue Bottle Coffee (0.5 km away)  
  456 Pike St, Seattle, WA
  
- Espresso Vivace (0.7 km away)
  789 Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA
  
... and 12 more
```
